## Something(s) about me

A silent listener from India. Trying to find the balance between being social and solitude. Over last 3 years, I have been involved in blockchain space. Which pointed me to my true interest: cryptography! Two causes that I deeply care about are Privacy and Climate Change.

## Things I like to do

In no specific order:

- Read books
- Write code
- Capture photos
- Run
- Cook, mostly Indian cuisine and no, its not restricted to northern India ;)
- DJ, deep house & techno
- Converse about: philosophy, economics & science
- Play guitar, although I suck at it
- Research on post-quantum cryptography
