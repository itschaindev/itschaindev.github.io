Living with a constant existential crisis can be difficult, but intriguing enough for a constant un-learn, re-learn cycle.

I hate the idea of _Societal Structures_, but I haven't escaped it, yet!

I do not belive in any religion or God, but open to existence of [Type 2 or 3 civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale).

Gap between polar opposites (good/bad, left/right, right/wrong, you get the drift...) are seeming to cease gradually, but I value human emotions and logical reasoning.

Trying to find the balance between being social and solitude. 


Over last 3 years, I have been involved in blockchain space. Which pointed me to my true interest: cryptography! 

Two causes that I deeply care about are Privacy and Climate Change.

Things I like to do, in no specific order:

- Read books
- Write code
- Capture photos
- Run
- Cook
- DJ - deep house & techno
- Converse about - philosophy, economics & science
- Play guitar
- Research on post-quantum cryptography
