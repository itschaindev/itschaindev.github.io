## Personal Notes

- Specific to “information privacy”
- Combining philosophical concepts with the need of information privacy
    - Privacy vs Autonomous decisions (possible at all?) - https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/07/surveillance-privacy-philosophy-data-internet-things
    - “The government is not forcing us to make a decision. But it is undermining our autonomy nonetheless, by making certain decisions – decisions about what to reveal to others – moot. “
    - “Knowledge may be transparent; but power rarely is. “
- A part of info taken out of context can be weaponised against you
- What makes us human is our individuality, creating a bubble, destroys that individuality
- Privacy with moral status of individual
- Motivation of using these platforms vs motivation to think about privacy
- Modern man is born in chains; only the law can set him free.
- Imagined reality is mostly the reason why no one actually takes accountability or that we are not able to counter for it….the conscience is distributed

- William Prosser, 1960
1. Intrusion upon a person’s seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs.
2. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about an individual.
3. Publicity placing one in a false light in the public eye.
4. Appropriation of one’s likeness for the advantage of another (Prosser 1960, 389).

Because the Supreme Court has been explicit in ruling that privacy is a central reason for Fourth Amendment protection, privacy as control over information about oneself has come to be viewed by many as also including protection against unwarranted searches, eavesdropping, surveillance, and appropriation and misuses of one’s communications.

The US has generally stood behind efficiency arguments that business and government need unfettered access to personal data to guarantee economic growth and national security, whereas the EU has sent a coherent signal that privacy has critical value in a robust information society because citizens will only participate in an online environment if they feel their privacy is guaranteed against ubiquitous business and government surveillance.

Privacy is valuable because it allows one control over information about oneself, which allows one to maintain varying degrees of intimacy. Indeed, love, friendship and trust are only possible if persons enjoy privacy and accord it to each other. Privacy is essential for such relationships on Fried’s view, and this helps explain why a threat to privacy is a threat to our very integrity as persons.

But one day in 1970 or 1971, with the intent to discredit Prochazka, the police began to broadcast these conversations [with Professor Vaclav Cerny, with whom he liked to drink and talk] as a radio serial. For the police it was an audacious, unprecedented act. And, surprisingly: it nearly succeeded; instantly Prochazka was discredited: because in private, a person says all sorts of things, slurs friends, uses coarse language, acts silly, tells dirty jokes, repeats himself, makes a companion laugh by shocking him with outrageous talk, floats heretical ideas he’d never admit in public, and so forth. Of course, we all act like Prochazka, in private we bad-mouth our friends and use coarse language; that we act different in private than in public is everyone’s most conspicuous experience, it is the very ground of the life of the individual; curiously, this obvious fact remains unconscious, unacknowledged, forever obscured by lyrical dreams of the transparent glass house, it is rarely understood to be the value one must defend beyond all others. Thus only gradually did people realize (though their rage was all the greater) that the real scandal was not Prochazka’s daring talk but the rape of his life; they realized (as if by electric shock) that private and public are two essentially different worlds and that respect for that difference is the indispensable condition, the sine qua non, for a man to live free; that the curtain separating these two worlds is not to be tampered with, and that curtain-rippers are criminals. And because the curtain-rippers were serving a hated regime, they were unanimously held to be particularly contemptible criminals. (Kundera, 1984, 261)

Privacy required for intimacy in love, friendships and every other social conundrum that we could imagine. Because we behave differently with different people and each of them have different level of access to our private life.

Privacy accords us the ability to control who knows what about us and who has access to us, and thereby allows us to vary our behavior with different people so that we may maintain and control our various social relationships, many of which will not be intimate.

Draft:

- Stop thinking from ‘I’ perspective. Think from average case perspective
- Kundera’s point of view of privacy
- Loss of Autonomy
    - Dystopian future
    - Thinking of imagined reality and the loyalty for them could be disastrous

### Alizzza

I part -> about your background -> opinion

Certain goods valued at more society perspective and not on private basis / individual for the I argument

Privacy is a luxury -> locking of door
Modern form of luxury of privacy we can afford
Clothes are a form of luxury

What parts of privacy is luxury and what is necessary
Why is privacy imp in digital context for learning?

Examples for being able to afford it

Personal way of elaboration for people to keep coming back
Don’t lose your personal touch and put jagrut’s way

When you do something once it might feel weird, second time a bit better but the 3rd time everything is ok. Accepting the new standard and not questioning the existing one.

Use -> philosophical argument which is applicable only to privacy (in general every topic) -> Pretty difficult to find!

### Sophiiee

I had to read the first point under ‚I‘ three times however. Maybe you can add an example for the beliefs and world view, cause this is also a very interesting argumentative point of view in the privacy debate

And the nudging theory fit in very well too. Maybe also an example, how privacy or data could be misused here?

### Bro

Very well written, but I still think that you could have   done better by diving (or writing) a bit more 😉 I felt I needed more explanation on the ideas you presented ... like I felt myself lost, I felt hungry for for more.... maybe I get it in the future articles

### Dahya

Ups : 
1. Very simple, yet powerfully moves oneself (atleast me)
2. Choosing of terms is excellent (but then I had a thought you spent quite some time about this)
3. Inter Connections for the stupid folks is very apt -- I loved the bathroom wala connect
4. Quotes are very well placed.

Downs: (minor che)
1. As adi already pointed out, grammar thoda (one or maybe two places) idhar udhar h, we can ignore that
2. I personally felt imagined realities ka example wonderful, but then could not connect well with the country thing, maybe was not needed, samaj to Apple se b aa hi gaya tha..

### Golu

Ups:

You will be able to get your point through to anyone. Make sure you share it the maximum so that people understand as this would be a very balanced article for them to understand privacy or atleast why it means so much to people who worry about privacy. 

Good balance of technical and laymen terms.. analogies are great ( extra points if you have thought abt them by your own).. those who wish to dive deeper can go to the extra info sources you have provided and those who dont wish to can let it be. 

Apt and perfectly sized article.

Personal note : for someone who has so many thoughts circling around, you have done a great job of cherry picking. Good for you.

Downs : 
Couldn't understand final note! Thought no need of it! But of course authors are free to express!
